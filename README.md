## What can I do?
•	I can do business analytics. For example, a SWOT analysis
•	Design? Yes, please, UX/UI basically create layouts using the Figma tool, Photoshop. For example, www.behance.net/comboskill , https://www.figma.com/file/07AQdD9fttEkpn19CdtArv/Untitled?node-id=1%3A313
•	I can turn the layout into codes, I can use both Float and flex, grid template. I use CSS3 variables, but if necessary, I can connect SCSS (for, if, mixin, etc.) or Less. I know how to connect the library and read the documentation. I use the BEM methodology. For example, Zipbooks, Gluu, Whatsbusy, comboskill, etc.
•	JavaScript is my favorite, I know such standards ES5-ES8, I can apply both with OOP and without. I wrote various interesting projects in pure JS, and also created Google Extensions.
•	From the JS libraries, I use React in practice, not counting jQuery. Due to the fact that I didn't write code for a short period of time, I started learning React with hooks, and I understand and apply Redux and Mobx. I can create reusable components.
•	To create the backend, I use Node.js on the Express platform, I use such template engines as ejs, hbs and pug. I know such modules as selenium, phantom, puppeteer
•	Databases - MongoDB and MySQL
•	I took various courses in marketing, SMM (Instagram, FB)



I love what I do and I aspire to create designs and experiences that can help solve problems and communicate both in anesthetic and functional sense. I am looking forward to work, learn on developing applications. A Passioniate towards learning and developing MERN || MEVN Stack sites, designing minimalistic UI/UX and Love sharing my knowledge, insights of learning with others through Blogging. Some of the technologies I enjoy working with include NodeJS, ReactJS, other JS frameworks and UI/UX samples with prototyping using Figma and 💎 Adobe XD.
